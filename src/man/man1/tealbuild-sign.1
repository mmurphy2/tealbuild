tealbuild sign - Creates detached GPG signatures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild sign\f[R] \f[I]file\f[R] [\f[I]email\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generates a new detached signature for a given file, which is normally a
package file (but can actually be any file).
Note that this command isn\[cq]t normally needed, since running:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tealbuild accept
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
will handle signing packages in the staging area automatically.
However, this command is provided for convenience in the event that a
custom signature is required for something.
If no \f[I]email\f[R] is specified, the default key in GPG_HOME is used
for signing.
