server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild repo-server\f[R] \f[I]start | stop | status\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Manages a simple HTTP server (the http.server module from Python 3),
using the repository tree (REPO) as the root.
The port and listen address of the server are configurable in the
REPO_SERVER_ADDRESS and REPO_SERVER_PORT settings in tealbuild.conf.
This server exists for the purpose of testing the repository with
third-party package management tools.
It is not for use in production (using Apache or NGINX for that).
.PP
To start the server, give the \[lq]start\[rq] argument.
The \[lq]stop\[rq] argument will terminate the server, while
\[lq]status\[rq] will indicate whether or not the server is running.
