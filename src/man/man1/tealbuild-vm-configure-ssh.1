tealbuild vm-configure-ssh - Interactively configures SSH in the virtual
machine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild vm-configure-ssh\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Interactively configures the SSH connection that TealBuild uses to
connect to the build VM.
The build VM must be started in persistent mode, and
/etc/ssh/sshd_config inside the build VM must have the directive:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
PermitRootLogin yes
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
After setting that directive, the SSH daemon must be restarted, and
/etc/rc.d/rc.sshd must be set executable so that sshd starts each time
the virtual machine boots.
.PP
This command is normally only needed once after creating a build VM.
