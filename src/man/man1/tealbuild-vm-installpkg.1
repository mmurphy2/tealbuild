tealbuild vm-installpkg - Installs a Slackware package into the build VM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild vm-installpkg\f[R] \f[I]package\f[R] [[\f[I]package\f[R]]
\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Installs one or more package files into the TealBuild virtual machine
using /sbin/installpkg inside the VM.
Note that the persistence of the installation will depend on the
persistence of the VM.
If the VM is running in snapshot mode, the installation will be lost
once the VM is terminated.
However, in persistent mode, the package will remain installed on the VM
permanently.
Caution must be exercised to avoid the potential of creating unintended
dependencies when building packages after another package has been
installed.
.PP
The \f[I]package\f[R] arguments are paths to Slackware packages on the
host file system.
These packages will be uploaded to the VM automatically.
