.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Removes a package file from the staging area (STAGE) and puts it in the
trash (TRASH).
This command is used to reject a package that will not be accepted into
the repository (e.g.\ due to a bad build or other issue).
Enabling TealBuild\[cq]s Bash completion is quite useful for this
command.
.PP
The packages that are available in the staging area, which could be
removed or accepted, may be displayed using:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tealbuild stage-list
\f[R]
.fi
