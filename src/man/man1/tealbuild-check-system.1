tealbuild check-system - Checks TealBuild prerequisites
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild check-system\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Runs checks on the system to ensure that the needed commands for running
TealBuild are present.
Since TealBuild is designed to run on any Linux distribution, this
command determines if the required software is present, but it does not
suggest the package names required for installing any missing software.
.PP
The exit status of this command is 0 if all checks pass, or non-zero if
one or more pieces of software are missing.
However, some programs are only needed when running specific commands,
so it may be possible to run TealBuild with some missing prerequisites.
