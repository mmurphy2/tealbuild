tealbuild repo-list - Lists packages in the repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild repo-list\f[R] [\f[I]prefix-pattern\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Lists the built packages in the repository (REPO).
An optional \f[I]prefix-pattern\f[R] may be employed to narrow the
package list if the repository has become well-populated.
This pattern will be prefixed to *.t?z when searching for packages.
Note that the actual directory searched is the architecture-specific
(set by ARCH) subdirectory of the repository.
.PP
Bash completion (enabled via \[lq]tealbuild complete\[rq]) is helpful
here.
