tealbuild upload-repo - Uploads the local repository to a remote system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild upload-repo\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Uploads the local repository (in the REPO directory) to a remote system.
The method used for uploading is configured in tealbuild.conf, the
template for which contains explanatory comments for configuring
repository uploads.
Basic checks are performed to ensure that a broken repository is not
uploaded.
.PP
In addition, the remote repository is checked for changes that have
occurred since the previous upload.
These checks are not completely devoid of race conditions if multiple
people or systems are updating the remote repository; however, the
checks are done in such a way that a remote update collision should be
an unlikely event.
In some instances, such as when changing GPG keys, it will be necessary
to skip these checks on upload.
Setting the variable TEALBUILD_FORCE_PUSH_REPO=YES (note: YES must be in
all caps) will skip the checks.
