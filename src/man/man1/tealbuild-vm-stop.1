tealbuild vm-stop - Stops the TealBuild virtual machine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild vm-stop\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Stops the TealBuild virtual machine.
When the VM is running in snapshot mode, as it does for building
packages, the stop process should be instant.
However, if a desktop environment is loaded in persistent mode, it may
be necessary to shut down the VM manually from within the QEMU window.
.PP
In snapshot mode, the QEMU \[lq]quit\[rq] monitor command is used to
cause a hard shutdown equivalent to pulling out the power plug on a
physical system.
This approach is fine in snapshot mode, since any modifications to the
disk are thrown away anyway, leaving nothing to corrupt.
However, in persistent mode, an ACPI shutdown request has to be sent
instead.
If the VM is left in runlevel 3 with no desktop environment started,
this request should be enough to cause an orderly shutdown.
However, some desktop environments intercept the ACPI request and
present a menu instead.
