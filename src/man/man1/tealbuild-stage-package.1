tealbuild stage-package - Adds prebuilt packages to the staging area
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild stage-package\f[R] \f[I]package\f[R] [[\f[I]package\f[R]]
\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Adds one or more binary packages directly to the staging area.
This command is used to enable TealBuild to perform repository
management tasks for packages that have been built outside TealBuild.
Another possible use case is to add third-party Slackware packages to a
private repository.
Note that no GPG checks are performed on the packages being added: the
user must verify the authenticity of such packages before staging them.
