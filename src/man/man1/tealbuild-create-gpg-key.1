tealbuild create-gpg-key - Generates a new package signing key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild create-gpg-key\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generates a new GPG key for signing packages, storing the resulting
keypair in GPG_HOME.
When running this command, it is recommended that a comment be added to
the effect that this key is a repository signing key.
It is recommended that a dedicated key be used for each package
repository (and therefore, each build tree).
However, a key may be shared between build trees (and repositories) by
setting common GPG_HOME locations in each build tree configuration.
