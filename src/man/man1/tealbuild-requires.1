.SH NAME
.PP
tealbuild requires - Calculates dependencies of a requested port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild requires\f[R] [[\f[I]port_name\f[R]] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild requires\f[R] calculates dependencies of a given
\f[I]port_name\f[R] and displays a build list with the original
\f[I]port_name\f[R] listed last.
This build list can then be used with the build command
(tealbuild-build(1)) to build a package with all its dependent packages
in one step.
The output of \f[B]tealbuild requires\f[R] can be used as the argument
list to \f[B]tealbuild build\f[R].
.PP
In the event that the original port name is not the last element in the
output, a circular dependency situation exists in the build tree.
Either the packages require iterative compilation (a true circular
dependency), or the .info files are wrong for one or more ports.
.PP
If executed without a \f[I]port_name\f[R], computes dependencies of all
ports in the tree.
More than one port may be specified on the command line to compute
dependencies for a smaller set of ports.
When used in this way, the output cannot be used as the argument list to
\f[B]tealbuild build\f[R].
.PP
By default, \f[B]tealbuild requires\f[R] operates on the REQUIRES line
of each .info file in the requested \f[I]port_name\f[R]s.
However, the BUILD_REQUIRES line may also be added, as documented below.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
\f[B]0\f[R]
Each port in the dependency list had a .info file, which allowed
dependencies to be resolved.
.TP
\f[B]1\f[R]
One or more ports lacked a .info file, so the dependency resolution may
be incomplete.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
\f[B]TEALBUILD_REQUIRES\f[R]
If the TEALBUILD_REQUIRES environment variable is set to
\[lq]build\[rq], then the BUILD_REQUIRES entries in .info files will be
processed in addition to, and after, the REQUIRES entries in the .info
files.
