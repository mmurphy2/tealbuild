tealbuild stage-review - Reviews the contents of packages in the staging
area
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild stage-review\f[R] [\f[I]prefix-pattern\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Displays the contents of the built packages in the staging area (STAGE).
An optional \f[I]prefix-pattern\f[R] may be employed to narrow the
package list if the staging area has become well-populated.
This pattern will be prefixed to *.t?z when searching for packages.
Note that the actual directory searched is the architecture-specific
(set by ARCH) subdirectory of the staging directory.
.PP
Bash completion (enabled via \[lq]tealbuild complete\[rq]) is helpful
here.
