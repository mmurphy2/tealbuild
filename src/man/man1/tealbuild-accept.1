tealbuild accept - Accepts packages from staging into the repository
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild accept\f[R] [[\f[I]package\f[R]] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Accepts one or more package files from the staging area (STAGE) into the
repository (REPO).
If no package files are listed, then all package files in the staging
area are accepted.
.PP
Package acceptance involves signing the package(s), creating package
metadata for each package, and moving the package(s) and metadata from
the staging area into the repository.
.PP
The general workflow is that packages are built (using the
\[lq]build\[rq] command) and then tested while still in the staging
area.
Those packages that are working are then accepted into the repository,
while ones that prove problematic are removed from staging (the
\[lq]stage-rm\[rq] command) and rebuilt after modifying the
corresponding port.
.PP
If a specific GPG signature (other than the default in GPG_HOME) needs
to be selected for signing purposes, set TEALBUILD_GPG_EMAIL to the
email address (or user-id) of the signing key.
Remember that the signing keys are stored in GPG_HOME and are, by
default, separate from the main GPG user directory (typically in
\[ti]/.gnupg).
.PP
Accepting a package that has a different version or build number than a
package of the same name that is already in the repository will archive
the original package from the repository.
This automation ensures that only one version of a package with a given
name is in the repository at any time.
