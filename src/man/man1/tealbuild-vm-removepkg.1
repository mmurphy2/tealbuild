tealbuild vm-removepkg - Uninstalls packages from the build VM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild vm-removepkg\f[R] \f[I]name\f[R] [[\f[I]name\f[R]] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Removes one or more installed packages from the TealBuild virtual
machine using /sbin/removepkg inside the VM.
Note that the persistence of the removal will depend on the persistence
of the VM.
If the VM is running in snapshot mode, the removal will be undone once
the VM is terminated.
However, in persistent mode, the package will remain removed from the VM
permanently.
Caution must be exercised to avoid breaking the VM.
