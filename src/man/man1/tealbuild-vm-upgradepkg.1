tealbuild vm-upgradepkg - Upgrades a package inside the TealBuild VM
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild vm-upgradepkg\f[R] \f[I]package\f[R] [[\f[I]package\f[R]]
\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Upgrades one or more package files into the TealBuild virtual machine
using /sbin/upgradepkg \[en]install-new inside the VM.
Note that the persistence of the installation will depend on the
persistence of the VM.
If the VM is running in snapshot mode, the installation will be lost
once the VM is terminated.
However, in persistent mode, the package will remain installed on the VM
permanently.
Caution must be exercised to avoid the potential of creating unintended
dependencies when building packages after another package has been
installed.
.PP
Paths to \f[I]package\f[R] targets are given on the host machine.
The package files will be uploaded to the virtual machine automatically.
