tealbuild build - Builds Slackware packages from ports
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild build\f[R] \f[I]portname\f[R] [[\f[I]portname\f[R]]
\&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Builds one or more packages from a port directory in the build tree, in
order from left to right, stopping if any build fails.
As part of the build process, the package build scripts and sources will
be copied from the port directory on the host machine into the TealBuild
virtual machine (which must be running in snapshot mode).
If the build VM is not yet running, and AUTOSTART_VM is set to
\[lq]yes\[rq] in the configuration, the VM will be started in snapshot
mode before starting the first build.
.PP
The specified names are the names of the individual port directories
inside the PORTS path.
As each resulting package is built, it is installed into the VM using
upgradepkg \[en]install-new, which permits upgrading from a prior build.
Since the VM is running in snapshot mode, the installations are only
temporary, and the VM will revert to its clean state upon shutdown.
.PP
To build two or more packages where one is dependent on another, specify
the dependent package(s) last.
For example, if package B depends on package A, and package C depends on
both A and B, run the command like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tealbuild build A B C
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If a package to be built depends on another package that was built in a
prior TealBuild session, and the binary package is available in either
the staging area or the repository, it will be installed into the build
VM at the start of the build process.
Otherwise, an error message will be displayed to indicate that a
prerequisite package is missing.
.PP
Once a package has been built successfully, the resulting binary package
is copied into the architecture-specific (based on the ARCH setting)
subdirectory of the staging area (STAGE).
.PP
If the VM was started automatically as part of the build process, it can
also be stopped, depending on the value of AUTOSTOP_VM.
If that variable is set to \[lq]always\[rq], the VM is always stopped,
regardless of build process exit status.
A setting of \[lq]never\[rq] never stops the VM.
If AUTOSTOP_VM is set to \[lq]on_success\[rq], the VM will be stopped if
the build succeeds.
Note that the VM will NOT be stopped if it was not started by the build
command.
.PP
Sources are checked (and fetched, if necessary) prior to starting the
build process.
If the environment variable TEALBUILD_INTERACTIVE is set to the
lower-case word \[lq]yes\[rq], then each listed package will be built,
and the user will be prompted to review the package contents and rebuild
if necessary.
If a build fails while running interactively, the user will have an
opportunity to fix the port and retry the build.
