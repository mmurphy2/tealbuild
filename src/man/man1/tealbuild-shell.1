tealbuild shell - Obtains a root shell on the TealBuild virtual machine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild shell\f[R] [\f[I]command\f[R]] [\f[I]args\f[R] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Initiates an SSH connection to the TealBuild virtual machine, logging in
as the root user.
If an optional command string is given, it will be run.
Otherwise, an interactive shell will be obtained on the VM.
This shell is more comfortable for working directly on the VM, since
copy and paste will work with the host system.
