tealbuild new-doinst - Generates a new doinst.sh.in file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild new-doinst\f[R] \f[I]port_name\f[R]
[\f[I]output_file\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generates a new doinst.sh.in file for a port with the specified name.
If an output_file is not given, the port must already exist within the
ports directory (PORTS).
If an existing doinst.sh.in file is found in the ports directory, the
newly generated file will have the .new extension.
.PP
Note that the generated file is always named doinst.sh.in, so that it
does not get included by accident in a generated package.
Before adding this file to a build, the file needs to be edited
carefully to ensure that it is correct.
Remember that doinsh.sh is run as root on all the systems making use of
the resulting package!
.PP
The output file is generated from a template named \[lq]doinst.sh\[rq],
which ships with TealBuild.
