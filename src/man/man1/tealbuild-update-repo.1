tealbuild update-repo - Updates the local repository metadata
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild update-repo\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Updates the local repository, generating the repository-level metadata,
including the package list, manifest, ChangeLog, checksums, and file
list.
Newly accepted packages are added to the repository metadata, and an
update to the ChangeLog.txt file is automatically generated.
If the public GPG key is not yet included in the repository, this
command also takes care of exporting it.
.PP
During the ChangeLog generation process, the user\[cq]s EDITOR (defaults
to vi) is invoked to enable manual adjustments to the ChangeLog.
It is important to follow the established format of the ChangeLog.txt,
as third-party package management tools may extract information from
this file.
Review the format of ChangeLog.txt on any Slackware mirror for the basic
layout.
.PP
Separators between ChangeLog.txt updates are added automatically.
