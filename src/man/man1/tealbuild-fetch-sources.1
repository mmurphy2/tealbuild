tealbuild fetch-sources - Downloads and verifies source files for a port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild fetch-sources\f[R] \f[I]port_name\f[R]
[[\f[I]port_name\f[R]] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Automatically downloads and verifies source files listed in the .info
files for the specified \f[I]port_name\f[R] argument(s).
Note that the download process is fairly simplistic and depends on the
correctness of the .info file.
If more than one \f[I]port_name\f[R] is given, the sources for the ports
will be downloaded in order, but the process will abort if any source
download fails, and subsequent \f[I]port_name\f[R]s will not be
attempted.
.PP
A \f[I]port_name\f[R] must be in the ports directory (PORTS) before this
command will be able to retrieve its source files.
To create a new port, or to import an existing one, see the help for the
\[lq]new\[rq] and \[lq]import\[rq] commands.
.PP
Verification will be performed using GPG if the .info file contains the
URLs of detached signature files in its GPG or GPG_x86_64 entries.
The GPG verification will be performed against the key listed in GPG_KEY
(which may be the path or URL to the public key, or the public key
itself).
If GPG information is not supplied by the .info file, MD5 verification
will be used instead.
