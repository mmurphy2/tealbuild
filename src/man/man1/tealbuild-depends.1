tealbuild depends - Recursively determines what ports depend on a given
port
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild depends\f[R] [[\f[I]port_name\f[R]] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Recursively computes the set of packages that depend on the specified
\f[I]port_name\f[R]s.
If no \f[I]port_name\f[R] is given, then a recursive computation is
performed for all ports in the tree (which is slow!).
The \f[B]tealbuild depends\f[R] command will determine what ports depend
directly on the specified port(s), as well as what ports depend
indirectly on the specified port(s) by depending on other ports that
depend on the specified port(s).
.PP
The purpose of this command is to gauge the impact a port has on other
ports in the collection when performing upgrades.
Due to the recursive way dependencies are calculated, this command is
slow to execute.
