tealbuild vm-install - Starts the build virtual machine for initial
installation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild vm-install\f[R] \f[I]iso | version\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Starts the TealBuild virtual machine in persistent mode for initial
installation.
The VM will be booted from the Slackware ISO file given as an argument
to this command.
From that point, the installation must be performed manually from inside
the VM.
.PP
If the Slackware ISO file has not yet been downloaded, a version number
can be specified instead.
TealBuild will download the installer ISO for that version, matching the
architecture set in ARCH (the host system architecture, by by default).
A released version of Slackware will be downloaded from the official
mirrors.
.PP
To build a Slackware -current ISO, give the word \[lq]current\[rq] as
the version number.
Building a -current ISO will first sync the Slackware software tree,
then build the ISO from that.
