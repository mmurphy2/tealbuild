.SH NAME
.PP
tealbuild import - Imports a port into the TealBuild build tree
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild import\f[R] \f[I]item\f[R] [[\f[I]item\f[R]] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Imports a port from the specified directory, tarfile, or URL.
The form of an importable directory is one that is named according to
the package name and contains the SlackBuild and other files.
An importable tarfile contains the same files as a directory, all of
which are organized under a single directory within the tarfile.
If a URL is specified, it must point to a tarfile that will be
downloaded and then extracted.
.PP
The tarfile download function has been tested with SlackBuilds.org.
Note that no GPG check of the tarfile is performed, since it is assumed
that the user will be manually reviewing the contents of the port for an
accurate download and to check for malicious code.
.PP
If multiple combinations of directories, tarfiles, and/or URLs are
provided, they will be imported in order.
If an error occurs, the process will abort at the point of the error,
and any further ports will not be imported into the build tree.
