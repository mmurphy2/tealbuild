tealbuild create-meta - Creates metadata for packages in staging
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild create-meta\f[R] \f[I]staged_package\f[R]
[[\f[I]staged_package\f[R]] \&...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Creates package metadata files (.manifest, .meta, and .txt) for one or
more listed packages in the staging area (STAGE).
The .manifest file contains a list of all files contained within the
package (and is later used to create the MANIFEST.bz2 file for the
repository), while the .meta file contains information about the package
(which is later used to create the PACKAGES.TXT file at the repository
level).
The .txt file is the description of the package as extracted from the
slack-desc file.
.PP
Note that running this command manually is generally not needed, unless
TealBuild is being used for some custom application.
Instead, the recommended workflow is to accept packages from the staging
area into the repository, which will trigger generation of both the
metadata and the package signature.
