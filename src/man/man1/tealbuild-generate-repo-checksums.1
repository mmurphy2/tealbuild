tealbuild generate-repo-checksums - Generates and signs the
CHECKSUMS.md5 file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]tealbuild generate-repo-checksums\f[R]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generates and signs the CHECKSUMS.md5 file for the local repository,
replacing any previous version of the file.
This file contains a list of the MD5 checksums for every other public
file in the repository, with the exception of FILELIST.TXT.
Third-party package managers rely on the CHECKSUMS.md5 file to validate
the contents of the repository, and they may validate the GPG signature
on CHECKSUMS.md5 using CHECKSUMS.md5.asc.
.PP
Note that it is not necessary to run this command directly.
The
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$ tealbuild update-repo
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
command will also perform this function as part of a repository update.
.PP
If running this command manually, it is important to run it
second-to-last, after generating the PKGLIST.TXT, MANIFEST.bz2, and
ChangeLog.txt, but before generating FILELIST.TXT.
If this command is run out of order, the repository is unlikely to work
properly with third-party package management tools.
